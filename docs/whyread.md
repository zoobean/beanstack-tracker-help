## Reading for 20 minutes a day exposes you to 1.8 million words a year.

* 20 minutes / day = 1.8 million words / year
* 5 minutes / day = 282,000 words / year
* 1 minute / day = 8,000 words / year

Young readers that are just beginning to read can benefit from reading with more experienced readers.

> "Twenty-six percent of children who were read to three to four times in the last week by a family member recognized all letters of the alphabet. This is compared to 14 percent of children who were read to less frequently."
