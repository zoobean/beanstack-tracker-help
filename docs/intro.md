## Adding Titles to the Reading and History Lists
### Add a Title to the Reading List
Use the reading list to keep track of titles you're currently reading through timed reading sessions.
1. When on "Log", tap `+` (top right) to add a new title.
2. Tap `Add to Reading`
3. Choose how you would like to enter the title's information. We suggest always trying `Scan Title ISBN` first. It will use your phone's camera to scan the title's ISBN barcode. On a successful scan, the title name, author, and [last page](#note-on-last-page-when-scanning-a-title-s-isbn) will be automatically filled in. If the title isn't found through the ISBN scan, you can enter the title's information manually with `Enter Title Info`.
> #### Tracking Progress
> By default, "Track Progress" is turned on. Tracking progress is a helpful feature that provides you with visual indications of your progress as you log reading sessions. After you log your first session, you'll see a colored bar under the title on "Log". This bar indicates your progress for that title. The "Progress" row on a title's detailed view shows a numerical percentage. You can get to a title's detailed view by tapping a title from "Log".

> #### Note on Last Page when Scanning a Title's ISBN
> For the ISBN scanner, Beanstack Tracker pulls a title's information from the Google Books API. We've found that the last page data we pull in from the API in isn't always accurate, so we recommend double checking to make sure it's correct.

4. Tap `Save`
